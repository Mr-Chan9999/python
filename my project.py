# Student Becomes the Teacher
"""
Lesson Number One
Welcome to this "Challenge Course". Until now we've been leading you by the hand and working on some short and relatively easy projects. This is a challenge so be ready. We have faith in you!
We’re going to switch it up a bit and allow you to be the teacher of your own class. Make a gradebook for all of your students.

    "dog": ["woof", "bark"],
    "fox": [],
}
print animal_sounds["cat"]
The example above is just to remind you how to create a dictionary and then to access the item stored by the "cat" key.
Instructions
Create three dictionaries: lloyd, alice, and tyler.
Give each dictionary the keys "name", "homework", "quizzes", and "tests".
Have the "name" key be the name of the student (that is, lloyd's name should be "Lloyd") and the other keys should be an empty list. (We'll fill in these lists soon!)

Great work!

It's Okay to be Average
When teaching a class, it's important to take the students' averages in order to assign grades.
5 / 2
# 2
5.0 / 2
# 2.5
float(5) / 2
# 2.5
The above example is a reminder of how division works in Python.
When you divide an integer by another integer, the result is always an integer (rounded down, if needed).
When you divide a float by an integer, the result is always a float.
To divide two integers and end up with a float, you must first use float() to convert one of the integers to a float.
Instructions
Write a function average that takes a list of numbers and returns the average.
Define a function called average that has one argument, numbers.
Inside that function, call the built-in sum() function with the numbers list as a parameter. Store the result in a variable called total.
Like the example above, use float() to convert total and store the result in total.
Divide total by the length of the numbers list. Use the built-in len() function to calculate that.
Return that result.

Just Weight and See
Great! Now we need to compute a student’s average using weighted averages.
cost = {
    "apples": [3.5, 2.4, 2.3],
    "bananas": [1.2, 1.8],
}
return 0.9 * average(cost["apples"]) + \
0.1 * average(cost["bananas"])
In the above example, we create a dictionary called cost that contains the costs of some fruit.
Then, we calculate the average cost of apples and the average cost of bananas. Since we like apples much more than we like bananas, we weight the average cost of apples by 90% and the average cost of bananas by 10%.
The \ character is a continuation character. The following line is considered a continuation of the current line.
Instructions
Write a function called get_average that takes a student dictionary (like lloyd, alice, or tyler) as input and returns his/her weighted average.
Define a function called get_average that takes one argument called student.
Make a variable homework that stores the average() of student["homework"].
Repeat step 2 for "quizzes" and "tests".
Multiply the 3 averages by their weights and return the sum of those three. Homework is 10%, quizzes are 30% and tests are 60%.
